# **Service Directory and Service Templates - DevOps Projects**

## **Overview**

These DevOps projects, comprising the **Service Directory** and **Service Templates**, are designed to streamline the process of infrastructure management and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) for web applications. Leveraging Pulumi for infrastructure as code (IaC) and AWS as the cloud provider, the Service Directory automates the deployment of frontend and backend services, while Service Templates provide a CLI tool to generate Docker and CI/CD configurations.

## **Service Directory**

### **Introduction**

The Service Directory project utilizes Pulumi to define and manage cloud resources on AWS, catering to both frontend and backend components of a web application. The frontend is hosted using AWS S3 and CloudFront, ensuring fast, globally available content delivery. The backend relies on AWS ECS and ECR for container orchestration and Docker image storage, respectively.

### **Features**

- **Automated Infrastructure**: Utilizes Pulumi for IaC to create and manage AWS resources.
- **Frontend and Backend Support**: Handles both components with appropriate AWS services.
- **Security and Networking**: Integrates IAM roles, security groups, and subnet configurations for secure and efficient deployment.

## **Service Templates**

### **Introduction**

Service Templates aim to simplify the CI/CD setup process by providing a CLI tool that generates Dockerfile and CircleCI configuration files based on predefined templates and service-specific settings defined in a **`build.json`** file.

### **Features**

- **Template-Based Configuration**: Offers Docker and CircleCI configuration templates that can be customized for different services.
- **CLI Tool**: Enables easy generation of Dockerfile and CircleCI config files using service-specific parameters.
- **Supports Multiple Services**: Can generate configurations for various services within a project, each with its own build, test, and deployment commands.

## **General Approach**

The general approach for using these projects is as follows:

1. **Service Directory**:
    - Define AWS resources using Pulumi's TypeScript syntax in the **`resources`** and **`services`** directories.
    - Configure AWS credentials and Pulumi stack settings.
    - Deploy resources using **`pulumi up`**.
2. **Service Templates**:
    - Define service configurations in **`build.json`**.
    - Run the CLI tool to generate Docker and CI/CD configurations.
    - Use the generated files in your CI/CD pipeline for building, testing, and deploying services.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- AWS CLI configured with your credentials.
- Pulumi CLI installed and logged in.
- Node.js and npm installed (for running the CLI tool in Service Templates).

### **Usage**

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the desired project directory (**`service-directory`** or **`service-templates`**).
2. Follow the project-specific instructions for configuration and deployment.
